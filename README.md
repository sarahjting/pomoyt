# pomoyt

Just making a little pomodoro thing for myself & also practicing Composition API.

## Todo
- Make it cute
- Add alarms
- Add playlist import/export with URLs
- Add drag/drop sorting to playlist
- Restart video when new video's selected
- Update selected video if it's removed from the playlist
- Add pomodoro length customization
- Add logging & some nice charts
- Check for the YT video's title instead of displaying the code
- Have a look at Vitest ig
